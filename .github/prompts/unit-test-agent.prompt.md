# Jest Unit Test Maintenance Prompt

My project uses Jest for unit testing and follows the best practices in `copilot-instructions.md`.

Please:

1. Review all test files and cases.
2. Fix or update any failing/outdated tests to match the current code and business logic.
3. Ensure all tests follow best practices (strict typing, accessibility, Fluent UI, etc.).
4. Add missing tests for uncovered code, especially for new features or bug fixes.
5. Use mocks/stubs for Office.js and external dependencies.
6. Run the full Jest test suite and report any remaining issues or failures.
7. Suggest improvements for test structure, organization, or coverage if needed.
